# Git Workshop

Welcome to the git workshop! This project is a guide for you to explore the world of git and github. Git is a type of version control software that allows you to save different versions of your work and allows many contributors to work on a single project. Hopefully this project will make you appreciate its intricacies and get more comfortable with it as you will be using it in many of your future classes and in industry. 

The way this works is each branch indicates a different level (there are two of them), most of the important files will be in the src folder in each branch and each branch's readme document will have the instructions. Try to do each of these activities on the terminal, try not to leave the terminal for the majority of this project.  

To begin, clone this repo by going to any local folder on your computer and typing `git clone https://github.com/AyushSehgal/git_workshop.git`  
CD into this folder, then start by going to the branch titled `level1` and to do this locally do: `git checkout level1`, then read the readme document and begin when ready!

## Disclaimer
This project was developed by Computer Science Mentors (CSM) at Berkeley to support students taking CS61B. This project is not a precursor to course project Gitlet and is not related to that project but is merely a way for students to get more comfortable with git, which can indirectly help with projects relating to it.
